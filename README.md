In this project, given a giant list of players, sort it 6 times, 
one by each skill, and once for total experience, and print the 6 lists to standard output. 

The program will read one command line argument and a list of lines from standard input. 
The one command line argument will either be: 'standard' for the standard library's sorting algorithm, or 'custom' for your own. 

Then, the program will read from standard input a list of lines in the following format:
SKILL_BREAKDANCING SKILL_APICULTURE SKILL_BASKET SKILL_XBASKET SKILL_SWORD


"high_scores.c" -- Project implementation<br />
"players_sample.dat" -- Example input<br />
"players_sample_out.txt" -- Correct output for the given input.<br />
"rand.py" -- Generates a random input file
